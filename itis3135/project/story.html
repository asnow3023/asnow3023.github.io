                        amount of space for habitation left for humanity. It is not uncommon to witness a non-human
                        creature in this universe, as if all fictional creatures have been magically started to exists
                        all suddenly.

                        monsters mostly hostile to human specimen. There also exists some ancient ruins with exceptional
                        technologies which indicates that humans once lived outside "The City" at some point in the
                        history. Some
                        group of treasure hunters or underlings of big corporations attempts to explore these ruins in
                        search for
                        ancient technologies, but only few or none return to tell stories of horrible nightmares they
                        suffered.</p>

                        standard on human lives. In the Backstreets and outskirts of The City, corpses of countless
                        bodies lay on ground until
                        the dawn sweeps by and Sweepers and Fixers clean the mess. Only a few individuals with little
                        justice left in their
                        heart takes arm and protects the innocent, yet the world remains unchanged in its violence and publicity of monstrousness in human character. The city has no name, and is split into 25 "Districts."

                    <p>Among the twenty-five members of Wings, <i>Lobotomy Corporation</i> was a corporation that took
                        lead in District 12 of The City. Lobotomy's singularity dealt with mysterous substance called
                        "Enkepalin" to create vast amount of eco-friendly energy using the substance. It is said that
                        Lobotomy Corporation was
                        able to provide an enough energy for the entire city just from a single branch office. This
                        influenced many
                        other corporations and the growth of advancement in singularities with the energy provided by
                        Lobotomy.

                    <p>However, the trustful company that many other members of the Wings depended on suddenly
                        disappeared in a course of seven days. For three days, the place where headquarter of Lobotomy
                        Corporation used to exist now severed
                        the sky with an enourmous ray of innocent light that brought dawn to the entire city for three
                        days. After three nightless
                        days, the city was then filled with pure darkness as if it was questioning the city when it ever
                        shined with day's warm light.
                        Evil-filled city with pure darkness exiled the daylight for three consecutive days, until the
                        darknes faded away and calmed the city with unspoken silence for a single day.

                    <p>With the fall of Lobotomy, District 12 soon fell into chaos, and various kinds of "Distortion" began to 
                        occur within The City. From a man becoming a pianist and causing massacre to thousands of people to 
                        an mysterous case of ascension of random individual to the sky, all kinds of abnormal situations began
                        to occur in The City after the fall of Lobotomy. And place where Lobotomy used to exist has been covered
                        in immersive fog that prohibits anyone to go near. The center of this distortion stands a tall library.
                        We call this The Library of Ruina.
